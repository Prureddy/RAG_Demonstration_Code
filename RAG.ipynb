Banks sell financial services such as car loans, home mort-gage loans, business loans, checking accounts, credit card services, certificates of deposit, and individual retirement accounts.

The process of starting a bank varies from state to state, but, in general, here’s how it goes: 1. A group of individuals decides to start a bank. Their first step is to apply for a charter from their state banking commission.* The charter sets out the rules for how they must operate their bank. 2.

After that, the banking commission will either approve the application or deny it.5. If approved, the group that applied to start the bank will then have a certain amount of time to raise the necessary capital, put together a full management team, and obtain federal deposit insurance. 6. When that’s done, the group will notify the banking commission, which will then review the list of proposed investors. If the commission has no objection to the list, if the bank is insured, \n",

But one thing hasn’t changed: Lenders don’t let you have their money for nothing. Lenders have no guarantee that they will get their money back. So why do they take the risk? Because lending presents an opportunity to make even more money. For example, if a bank lends $50,000 to a borrower, it is not satisfied just to get its $50,000 back.

        "## How it works:\n",
        " The SemanticChunker calculates the cosine similarity between the embeddings of consecutive sentences. It then calculates the difference between the similarity of a sentence to itself (which will always be 1) and its similarity to the next sentence. These differences are collected for the entire text.\n",

        "The breakpoint_threshold_amount=80 means that the chunker will find the 80th percentile of these similarity differences. Any difference in similarity that is greater than this 80th percentile value will be considered a breakpoint, and the text will be split at that point.\n",

        "\n",
        "A higher percentile (e.g., 90) means the threshold is higher. This results in fewer splits and larger chunks because only very large changes in similarity will trigger a split.\n",
